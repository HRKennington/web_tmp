I am a graduate student in the Edith O'Donnell Institute of Art History at The University of Texas at Dallas. My research 
interests include Colonial Arts of the Americas, as well as Archaeology of the Caribbean. I also enjoy 
studying Native Contemporary Art.

Here you will find some [informal posts](/blog), [my CV](/pages/cv) and [publications](/pages/publications). You may contact me 
at [hxb130430@utdallas.edu](mailto:hxb130430@utdallas.edu).

Away from the artifacts, I spend most of my traveling, scuba diving, photography, hiking, and fishing.
